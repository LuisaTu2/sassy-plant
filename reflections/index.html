      <div class="section-title">Intro</div>

      Last summer I tried gardening for the very first time. Armed with recycled
      coffee cups and cheap soil, I germinated store-bought seeds, tracked frost
      dates and planted the surviving seedlings in my small yard.

      <br />
      <br />

      I quickly realized that plants showed different
      <span class="highlight">personalities</span> based on their care and
      needs. Tomatoes and marigolds almost craved a bit of neglect, while basil
      and roses would show me the middle leaf and dramatically wilt when the pH
      level wasn’t just right.

      <br />
      <br />
      If basil could have spoken, she would surely have been a cranky one,
      always complaining about something! So when I came across the
      <a class="highlight-link" href="https://luma.com/4av8ffhb?tk=ZlAcOu"
        >voice AI hackathon</a
      >
      opportunity, I thought: why not use AI to make a sassy plant talk to me?

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="section-title">The Sassiest of Houseplants</div>

      Meet the one and only,
      <span class="highlight">Lady Monstera Deliciosa</span>! She is native to
      the tropical forests of southern Mexico, and is also known as the “Swiss
      cheese plant” due to the holes or “eyes,” that develop in her leaves,
      resembling the holes in Emmental cheese.

      <br />
      <br />

      With her dramatic and "cheesy" green leaves, it was easy to pick my
      Monstera plant as the perfect
      <span class="highlight">sassy talking plant</span>!

      <div class="section-title">Tech Details</div>
      <div style="text-align: left">
        In order to understand the plant's state at any point in time, I
        connected a
        <span class="highlight">phototransistor</span> and a
        <span class="highlight">soil moisture</span> sensor to an Arduino. Here
        are the schematics:
      </div>

        src="assets/schematics_plant.png"
        alt="Arduino schematics with light and water sensors"
        class="schematics"
      />
      <div class="img-comment-section">
        <div class="img-comment-title">
          <div class="square-dot">🟦</div>
          <div class="img-comment-title-text">Fig. 1 - Arduino Setup</div>
        </div>
        <div class="img-comment-text">
          <ul style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>
              The moisture sensor (MS) connects the plant to the Arduino (A) via
              a 3.3V voltage and outputs data on A0.
            </li>
            <li>
              The phototransistor (P) connects to 5V on Arduino (A), 10 &ohm;
              resistor. Data is read on the analog output A2.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br />

      The <span class="highlight">Arduino</span> collects the sensors data and
      sends it over to the back-end (a Python FastAPI application) via
      asynchronous serial communication. The data is then processed and
      displayed in React on the front-end. I used a combination of WebSockets
      and Http for communication across the stack. I am fairly new to
      <span class="highlight">WebSockets</span>, so it was really cool
      implementing a two-way street communication channel between back-end and
      front-end.

      <br />
      <br />

      I used GPT-4o by OpenAI to handle
      <span class="highlight">text-to-speech (TTS)</span> communication and give
      Lady Monstera her voice.

      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <div class="section-title">From Sensors to Speech</div>

      Seeing the plant’s internal state read in real time was absolutely
      thrilling! I tracked water and light changes over 5-second intervals, and
      let the plant comment on significant state changes. Here is how Lady
      Monstera recently handled an abrupt dimming of the lights:

        <video width="640" height="360" controls id="video-shade">
          <source src="assets/sassy-plant-shade.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          <!-- Your browser does not support the video tag. -->
        </video>
      </div>
      <!-- <br />
      <br />
      As you can see, she is also capable of detecting changes in light
      <span class="highlight">mid-speech</span> but doesn’t send a talking
      notification while she is already talking. -->

      And here is how she reacted to being watered!

      <div class="video">
        <video width="640" height="360" controls id="video-water">
          <source src="assets/sassy-plant-water.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          <!-- Your browser does not support the video tag. -->
        </video>
      </div>

      Notice how she records and <span class="highlight">updates</span> the last
      time she was watered. Anything to remind you how sassy she is, and how she
      won’t forgive you for forgetting to water her!

      <br />

      <div class="section-title">Reflections and Future Opportunities</div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I opted for
          <span class="highlight">text-to-speech</span> instead of realtime
          speech. Realtime was very sensitive to ambient noise, difficult to
          control and it quickly became too expensive to experiment with.
        </li>
        <li>
          It would be fun to <span class="highlight">gamify</span> the
          experience, with multiple plants talking to each other, each with
          distinct personalities based on their needs. Maybe even connect
          hobbyist gardeners and let their plants gossip about their owners 🤭
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, I hope this project helps us get
          <span class="highlight">closer to our house plants</span> and the
          nature around us, reduce house plant neglect and make interacting with
          our green friends a little more entertaining and curiosity driven.
        </li>
      </ul>

        >Waterloo Voice AI hackathon</a
      >
      was my first ever real-world hackathon and I loved every minute of it.
      Coding next to other hackers, exchanging ideas and simply absorbing the
      energy and enthusiasm in the room has left an indelible mark on me. It has
      given me the confidence to keep building, no matter how silly or small the
      initial idea might seem.
      <br />
      <br />
      A big <span class="highlight">thank you</span> to the organizers and
      judges, in particular
